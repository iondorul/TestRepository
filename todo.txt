Musts:
- dialog to bootstrap popup?
- fix empty reports
- add link to Reports from the Manage screen


Bugs:
- 2 date controls in same form fail
- confirm password
- upload field crash when 2 action form exist on same page

Actions
- revoke roles
- post to new window

Validations
- migrate to a new table
- any number of validators
- defined order
- attach events

Fields
- Upload
  - choose between starting immediately or waiting for submit


Buttons
- eliminate similar controls (like yes/no/maybe or horizontal/vertical checkboxes or country code/name and region code/name) - even if we support them, just add them as a radiogroup with a few options already added
- ability to attach icons to buttons 
- sort submit buttons
- buttons in the dialog (main.ascx.cs:170)
- warning if there's no submit button

- remove WndTextEditor?


- HelpText /Short Desc? => placeholder
- escape html?
- required checkboxes and radios
- form align
- Key Field



- switch between rich edit and text edit and html edit

- migrate ItemsFromConfig to ConfigFolder

- lang for fields

- how to localize config files?

- cleanup SaveReportLogs mess

Action Lists
- Group actions in Add Action
- required fields
- other validations
- Implement actions
  - [almost done - remove on final submit?] save report
- specific order of actions in list of Add Action dropdown

- page picker
- file picker

- flag if supports MyTokens

- Preview Entry
- My Entries
- Draft/Final


- on add actions ask where you want to add with highlighers (alert-block)?
- custom admin config forms per action

- handle .resouce files

- reimplement force download

- "your download will begin shortly" message?

- don't save passwords in report

- colapse actions on save/delete?

- button to go back from the new admin



Optimizations:

- miniify

Change config format
Remove control classes
Cleanup label controls
Auto add validators for Email and Username fields
Load titles from config with or without localization


Submit types
- normal POST
- AJAX (current)
- in an iFrame


Autosave draft

Turn fields into true tokens
